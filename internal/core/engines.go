its LUID, which D3DKMT reports too, and the engine is its physical index and
engine index; the type ("3D", "Copy", "VideoDecode") is what Task Manager
labels the engine with.

BusiestEngine is an adapter's utilisation as Task Manager gives it: each
engine's use summed over every process, and the busiest engine.

**The busiest, not the sum or the mean.** A card decoding video with its 3D
engine idle is busy, and saying so is the point of the number; a mean over a
dozen engines, most of which are never used, reads a saturated encoder as 8 %.
An engine summed over processes can pass 100 on a counter's rounding and is
held to it.

values maps instance names to percentages; instances of other adapters, and
names that are not instances, are passed over. ok is false where the adapter
has no instance at all.
